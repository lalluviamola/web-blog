<center><h3>Use the best tools</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">

<p align="justify">
Men in engaging employees should be careful to get the best.
Understand, you cannot have too good tools to work with, and
there is no tool you should be so particular about as living
tools. If you get a good one, it is better to keep him, than
keep changing. He learns something every day, and you are
benefited by the experience he acquires. He is worth more to
you this year than last, and he is the last man to part with,
provided his habits are good, and he continues faithful. If, as
he gets more valuable, he demands an exorbitant increase of
salary, on the supposition that you can't do without him, let
him go. Whenever I have such an employee, I always discharge
him; first, to convince him that his place may be supplied, and
second, because he is good for nothing if he thinks he is
invaluable and cannot be spared.
</p>

<p align="justify">
But I would keep him, if possible, in order to profit from the
result of his experience. An important element in an employee
is the brain.  You can see bills up, "Hands Wanted," but
"hands" are not worth a great deal without "heads."  Mr. Beecher
illustrates this, in this wise:
</p>

<p align="justify">
An employee offers his services by saying, "I have a pair of
hands and one of my fingers thinks." "That is very good," says
the employer. Another man comes along, and says "he has two
fingers that think." "Ah! that is better." But a third calls in
and says that "all his fingers and thumbs think." That is
better still. Finally another steps in and says, "I have a
brain that thinks; I think all over; I am a thinking as well as
a working man!" "You are the man I want," says the delighted
employer.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Those men who have brains and experience are therefore the most
valuable and not to be readily parted with; it is better for
them, as well as yourself, to keep them, at reasonable advances
in their salaries from time to time.
