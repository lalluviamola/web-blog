The eye of the employer is often worth more than the hands of a
dozen employees. In the nature of things, an agent cannot be so
faithful to his employer as to himself. Many who are employers
will call to mind instances where the best employees have
overlooked important points which could not have escaped their
own observation as a proprietor. No man has a right to expect
to succeed in life unless he understands his business, and
nobody can understand his business thoroughly unless he learns
it by personal application and experience.  A man may be a
manufacturer; he has got to learn the many details of his
business personally; he will learn something every day, and he
will find he will make mistakes nearly every day. And these
very mistakes are helps to him in the way of experiences if he
but heeds them. He will be like the Yankee tin-peddler, who,
having been cheated as to quality in the purchase of his
merchandise, said: "All right, there's a little information to
be gained every day; I will never be cheated in that way
again." Thus a man buys his experience, and it is the best kind
if not purchased at too dear a rate.

I hold that every man should, like Cuvier, the French
naturalist, thoroughly know his business. So proficient was he
in the study of natural history, that you might bring to him
the bone, or even a section of a bone of an animal which he had
never seen described, and, reasoning from analogy, he would be
able to draw a picture of the object from which the bone had
been taken. On one occasion his students attempted to deceive
him.  They rolled one of their number in a cow skin and put him
under the professor's table as a new specimen.  When the
philosopher came into the room, some of the students asked him
what animal it was. Suddenly the animal said "I am the devil
and I am going to eat you." It was but natural that Cuvier
should desire to classify this creature, and examining it
intently, he said:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Divided hoof; graminivorous! it cannot be done."
</p>

<p align="justify">
He knew that an animal with a split hoof must live upon grass
and grain, or other kind of vegetation, and would not be
inclined to eat flesh, dead or alive, so he considered himself
perfectly safe.  The possession of a perfect knowledge of your
business is an absolute necessity in order to insure success.

Among the maxims of the elder Rothschild was one, an apparent
paradox: "Be cautions and bold." This seems to he a
contradiction in terms, but it is not, and there is great
wisdom in the maxim. It is, in fact, a condensed statement of
what I have already said. It is to say, "you must exercise your
caution in laying your plans, but be bold in carrying them
out." A man who is all caution, will never dare to take hold
and be successful; and a man who is all boldness, is merely
reckless, and must eventually fail. A man may go on "'change"
and make fifty or one hundred thousand dollars in speculating
in stocks, at a single operation. But if he has simple boldness
without caution, it is mere chance, and what he gains to-day he
will lose to-morrow. You must have both the caution and the
boldness, to insure success.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The Rothschilds have another maxim: "Never have anything to do
with an unlucky man or place."  That is to say, never have
anything to do with a man or place which never succeeds,
because, although a man may appear to be honest and
intelligent, yet if he tries this or that thing and always
fails, it is on account of some fault or infirmity that you may
not be able to discover but nevertheless which must exist.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There is no such thing in the world as luck. There never was a
man who could go out in the morning and find a purse full of
gold in the street to-day, and another to-morrow, and so on,
day after day. He may do so once in his life; but so far as
mere luck is concerned, he is as liable to lose it as to find
it.  "Like causes produce like effects."  If a man adopts the
proper methods to be successful, "luck" will not prevent him.
If he does not succeed, there are reasons for it, although,
perhaps, he may not be able to see them.
