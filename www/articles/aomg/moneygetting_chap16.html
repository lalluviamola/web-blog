<center><h3>Don't indorse without security</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">

<p align="justify">
I hold that no man ought ever to indorse a note or become
security for any man, be it his father or brother, to a greater
extent than he can afford to lose and care nothing about,
without taking good security. Here is a man that is worth
twenty thousand dollars; he is doing a thriving manufacturing
or mercantile trade; you are retired and living on your money;
he comes to you and says:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"You are aware that I am worth twenty thousand dollars, and
don't owe a dollar; if I had five thousand dollars in cash, I
could purchase a particular lot of goods and double my money in
a couple of months; will you indorse my note for that amount?"
</p>

<p align="justify">
You reflect that he is worth twenty thousand dollars, and you
incur no risk by indorsing his note; you like to accommodate
him, and you lend your name without taking the precaution of
getting security. Shortly after, he shows you the note with
your indorsement canceled, and tells you, probably truly, "that
he made the profit that he expected by the operation," you
reflect that you have done a good action, and the thought makes
you feel happy. By and by, the same thing occurs again and you
do it again; you have already fixed the impression in your mind
that it is perfectly safe to indorse his notes without
security.
</p>

<p align="justify">
But the trouble is, this man is getting money too easily. He
has only to take your note to the bank, get it discounted and
take the cash. He gets money for the time being without effort;
without inconvenience to himself. Now mark the result. He sees
a chance for speculation outside of his business. A temporary
investment of only $10,000 is required. It is sure to come back
before a note at the bank would be due. He places a note for
that amount before you.  You sign it almost mechanically. Being
firmly convinced that your friend is responsible and
trustworthy, you indorse his notes as a "matter of course."
</p>

<p align="justify">
Unfortunately the speculation does not come to a head quite so
soon as was expected, and another $10,000 note must be
discounted to take up the last one when due. Before this note
matures the speculation has proved an utter failure and all the
money is lost. Does the loser tell his friend, the indorser,
that he has lost half of his fortune? Not at all. He don't even
mention that he has speculated at all. But he has got excited;
the spirit of speculation has seized him; he sees others making
large sums in this way (we seldom hear of the losers), and,
like other speculators, he "looks for his money where he loses
it." He tries again. Indorsing notes has become chronic with
you, and at every loss he gets your signature for whatever
amount he wants. Finally you discover your friend has lost all
of his property and all of yours.  You are overwhelmed with
astonishment and grief, and you say "it is a hard thing; my
friend here has ruined me," but, you should add, "I have also
ruined him."  If you had said in the first place, "I will
accommodate you, but I never indorse without taking ample
security," he could not have gone beyond the length of his
tether, and he would never have been tempted away from his
legitimate business. It is a very dangerous thing, therefore,
at any time, to let people get possession of money too easily;
it tempts them to hazardous speculations, if nothing more.
Solomon truly said "he that hateth suretiship is sure."
</p>

<p align="justify">
So with the young man starting in business; let him understand
the value of money by earning it. When he does understand its
value, then grease the wheels a little in helping him to start
business, but remember, men who get money with too great
facility, cannot usually succeed.  You must get the first dollars
by hard knocks, and at some sacrifice, in order to appreciate
the value of those dollars.
