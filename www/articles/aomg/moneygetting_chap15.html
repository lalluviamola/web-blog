<center><h3>Beware of "outside operations"</h3></center>

<div class="bodycopy">

<p align="justify">
We sometimes see men who have obtained fortunes, suddenly
become poor. In many cases, this arises from intemperance, and
often from gaming, and other bad habits. Frequently it occurs
because a man has been engaged in "outside operations," of some
sort. When he gets rich in his legitimate business, he is told
of a grand speculation where he can make a score of thousands.
He is constantly flattered by his friends, who tell him that he
is born lucky, that everything he touches turns into gold. Now
if he forgets that his economical habits, his rectitude of
conduct and a personal attention to a business which he
understood, caused his success in life, he will listen to the
siren voices. He says:
</p>

<p align="justify">
"I will put in twenty thousand dollars. I have been lucky, and
my good luck will soon bring me back sixty thousand dollars."
</p>

<p align="justify">
A few days elapse and it is discovered he must put in ten
thousand dollars more; soon after he is told "it is all right,"
but certain matters not foreseen, require an advance of twenty
thousand dollars more, which will bring him a rich harvest; but
before the time comes around to realize, the bubble bursts, he
loses all he is possessed of, and then he learns what he ought
to have known at the first, that however successful a man may
be in his own business, if he turns from that and engages in a
business which he don't understand, he is like Samson when
shorn of his locks--his strength has departed, and he becomes
like other men.
</p>

<p align="justify">
If a man has plenty of money, he ought to invest something in
everything that appears to promise success, and that will
probably benefit mankind; but let the sums thus invested be
moderate in amount, and never let a man foolishly jeopardize a
fortune that he has earned in a legitimate way, by investing it
in things in which he has had no experience.
