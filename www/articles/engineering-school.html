    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>This is a summary of <a href=
    "http://wean1.ulib.org/cgi-bin/metawin-lectures.pl?target=Lectures/Distinguished%20Lectures/2000">
    Rick Catell's talk</a>. You can watch in on-line (or download to your hard-drive and watch
    off-line as I did) thanks to the <a href="http://www.ul.cs.cmu.edu/">Universal Library
    project</a>.</p>

    <p>Rick is a Distinguished Engineer at Sun with years of experience behind his belt and in this
    talk he shares his experience. My comments are <i>in italic.</i></p>

    <h3>What does Rick wish he learned in Engineering School</h3>

    <p>Focus. Don't try to do everything yourself. Example: Xerox PARC tried to build everything
    from ground up: hardware, OS, software. Same with SGI.</p>

    <p>1% of leaders are responsible for most success. Good leaders need to have:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>market vision</li>

      <li>technical vision</li>

      <li>drive, so that they can get things done</li>

      <li>leadership</li>
    </ul>
    A simple math tells us that a number of people that have all those skills developed above
    average is very small. Lesson: pick your leaders wisely. <br>
     
    <p>Suboptimal decision is better than no decision.</p>

    <p>Trust in an organization is inversely proportional to distance. That e.g. explains why
    everyone went to develop their own versions of Unix (Irix, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX etc.) even
    though it was in their best interest to cooperate - the couldn't get to trust each other that
    co-operatively developed version would fill their needs.</p>

    <p>Engineers follow the leader. An example of a project where everyone was moved except the
    leader - soon all the engineers resigned from the project.</p>

    <p>Organizations are self-preserving. <i>The book <a href=
    "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743225716/">"Survival is not enough"</a> talks more
    about this. Successfull organizations resist change because they have a winning strategy. The
    danger is that they are likely to miss the next winning strategy.</i></p>

    <p>You needs more pigs than chickens (committed people vs. just participants). The analogy
    comes from ham &amp; eggs breakfast: pig is committed, chicken just participates.</p>

    <p>Most research and startups won't succeed.</p>

    <p>Innovation will happen elsewhere - no matter how big you are, you can't hire all the smart
    people in the industry.</p>

    <p>You have to sell your ideas.</p>

    <p>Don't base a risky project on another risky one.</p>

    <p>Know your customer, eat your own dogfood.</p>

    <p>Being first is more important than being best (from the book <a href=
    "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">"The 22 immutable laws of marketing".</a>)
    <i>Some people think different. <a href="http://www.cooper.com/">Allan Cooper</a> and <a href=
    "http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a> say that it's more important to have a good product
    later than bad product right now and debunk the "first mover" advantage. Maybe it's about
    finding the proper balance?</i></p>

    <p>Catch the wave of new markets and technology. If you catch the wave you might end up very
    well off even if you make tons of mistake (<i>Internet Bubble, anyone?</i>). But a new wave
    doesn't happen often.</p>

    <p>Physics overcome fine print. Natural tendencies will take over the relationship regardless
    of the arrangements you might make.</p>

    <p>Beware success-blindness - don't just stay fat &amp; happy. <i>Mainframe makers missed the
    micro-compter revolution.</i></p>

    <p>Focus on the achievable, not impossible or inevitable.</p>

    <p>Carrier advice: prioritize tasks every day, week year. Also:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>focus on relevant</li>

      <li>figure out what not to do (time is the most precious commodity)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Figure out what you want and how to get there. Make plans but allow them to change. </p>

    <p>Don't get too good at things you don't like to do. From the book "Your money or your life":
    most people said that they wouldn't be doing what they do if they didn't have to worry about
    money.</p>

    <p>Figure out ways to be more productive. If you do something often - take time to figure out
    ways to do it faster e.g. learn touch-typing if you have to type a lot.</p>

    <p>Learn writing, speaking, negotiation and business skills.</p>

    <p>Do the right thing, not the corporate thing.</p>
