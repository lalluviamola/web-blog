<h1>Why optimize?</h1>

<h2>A manifesto.</h2>

<p>In 1985, more than 20 years ago, Commodore released Amiga 1000. It had everything that a modern operating system of 2008 has: pre-emptive multitasking, <span class="caps">GUI</span> subsystem, a mouse.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s successor, Amiga 500, ran on 7 MHz processor and 512 KB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and it ran fast.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to accept that at the time of its release it was years ahead of competition.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s harder to accept that in 2008 the memory of Amiga&#8217;s performance shames the latest offering from Microsoft, that makes me wait before showing a content of a directory on a hard-drive, despite having hundreds times more memory and <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles to spare.</p>

<p>Poor performance can be partially explained by bigger and more complicated world today. Bigger screen resolutions mean more memory and <span class="caps">CPU</span> cycles are needed to handle the display. Bigger hard-drives mean more files which translates into more data we need to cache etc.</p>

<p>However, even bigger blame lays on the shoulders of countless programmers who manage to starve the fastest CPUs and use up all the memory through design and coding incompetence.</p>

<p>This book is for the few, the proud, who want to back that trend.</p>

<p>This book is for those who take professional pride in making the code use the least amount of resources possible.</p>

<p>This book is for those for whom extreme is only the beginning.</p>

<h2>Mobile &amp; embedded markets.</h2>

<p>They are growing and in mobile &amp; embedded context small size and low resource usage is important.</p>

<h2>Free advertising from delighted users.</h2>

<p>Users will notice that your application is smaller and faster than competition. It will delight them and that will give them something to talk about on their blogs => free advertising. Examples: Sumatra <span class="caps">PDF</span>, uTorrent (?)</p><hr>
