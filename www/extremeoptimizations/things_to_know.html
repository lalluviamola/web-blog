<h1>Basic things you need to know.</h1>

<p>When optimizing for size, you need to know what the sizes are and what other factors increase or decrease size.</p>

<h2>Sizes of basic C types</h2>

<p>C has few fundamental types and it&#8217;s important to know how much memory they use:</p>

<ul>
<li>char &#8211; 1 byte</li>
<li>short &#8211; 2 bytes</li>
<li>int &#8211; 4 bytes on 32-bit machines, 4 or 8 on 64-bit</li>
<li>long &#8211; like int</li>
<li>pointer &#8211; 4 bytes on 32-bit machines, 8 bytes on 64-bit machines</li>
<li>wchar_t &#8211; 2 bytes on Windows, 4 bytes on posix (unix)</li>
</ul>

<p>C standard unfortunately doesn&#8217;t dictate the size for int and long types and it might depend on the compiler you&#8217;re using or target for which you&#8217;re compiling (i.e. 32 bit vs. 64 bit, <span class="caps">ARM</span> vs. Intel).</p>

<p>If you want to operate on exact sizes, define specific types like <code>i16</code>, <code>i32</code>, <code>i64</code> etc. and use preprocessor tricks to typedef them to the right type in your compiler.</p>

<p>The exact name doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; I like short ones but you&#8217;ll find <code>int_16_t</code>. A practical concern is being able to use other peoples code (or make your code re-usable by others) so a good policy is to only use those typedefs internally but do not expose them in public interfaces.</p>

<h2>Layout of structures</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s the size of this structure:</p>

<code class="cpp"><pre>
struct foo {
    char c1;
    int i1;
};
</pre></code>

<p>Naive math would give you 5 bytes: 1 byte for char and 4 bytes for i1. But it&#8217;s 8.</p>

<p>C laids out fields in the structures using natural alignment i.e. since int is 4 bytes in size, its position in the structure will be aligned at 4 byte boundary.</p>

<p>C is a very low-level language and it lays out variables in the exact order you specified, even if it&#8217;s not optimal. It&#8217;s therefore up to you to order them in the most efficient order. In this case it would be:</p>

<p>The rule of thumb here is to put largest fields first, smallest last.</p>

<code class="cpp"><pre>
struct foo {
    int i1;
    char c1;
};
</pre></code>

<h2>Malloc overhead.</h2>

<p>How many bytes do you steal from OS when you call <code>malloc(1)</code>? Again, naive math would indicate 1.</p>

<p>Allocation process, however, is not magic. Allocator has to track allocations, which takes memory. The exact number for per-allocation overhead depends on the allocator, but you can expect this to be at least 8 bytes (which, when you think about it, is only 2 pointers).</p>

<p>Another overhead comes from allocation rounding. The specifics again depend on the allocator &#8211; on Windows allocations are rounded by 16 bytes.</p>

<p>The bottom line is: avoid lots of small allocations. 8 byte overhead for 256 byte allocation isn&#8217;t much, 22 byte overhead for 2 byte allocation is a lot.</p>

<h2>Memory hierarchies.</h2>

<p>Modern processors are super fast. Memory access, on the other hand, is slow. Accessing data on a hard-drive is in its own class of slowness.</p>

<p>To alleviate the slowness of memory access, modern processors employ level 1 (L1) and level 2 (L2) caches. L1 and L2 memory is much faster than main <span class="caps">RAM</span> but they&#8217;re also much more expensive, so you can only afford very little L1 and L2 caches.</p>

<p>The important thing to know is relative cost of memory accesses compared to the cost of an instruction. Here&#8217;s the breakdown for modern <span class="caps">CPU</span> (<a href="http://www.nwcpp.org/Downloads/2007/Machine_Architecture_-_NWCPP.pdf">http://www.nwcpp.org/Downloads/2007/Machine_Architecture_-_NWCPP.pdf</a>):</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Store</th>
	<th>Size</th>
	<th>Access cost (clocks)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Registers</td>
	<td>64B</td>
	<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>L1 cache</td>
	<td>32KB</td>
	<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>L2 cache</td>
	<td>4MB</td>
	<td>14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>DRAM</td>
	<td>4GB</td>
	<td>200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Disk</td>
	<td>500GB</td>
	<td>15M</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The exact numbers vary per <span class="caps">CPU</span>, but this is roughly correct.</p>

<p>What this data says is that storing data on disk is a performance disaster: you can execute millions <span class="caps">CPU</span> instructions in the time taken to read the data. Of course you can&#8217;t avoid using disk but you can win big by choosing compact representation of the data and even compressing/decompressing data when writing/reading data to/from a file.</p>

<p>A corollary: you loose big when you choose a bad, verbose file format e.g. <span class="caps">XML</span>.</p>

<p>What it also says is that even accessing data in <span class="caps">RAM</span> is slow &#8211; you can execute 200 instructions in the time taken to access a byte in <span class="caps">RAM</span>. This means that choosing more compact representation which requires more instructions to decode than a straightforward representation can (counterintuitively) speed up the program because cutting down the time spent accessing memory more than offsets additional <span class="caps">CPU</span> instructions needed to decode the data.</p><hr>
