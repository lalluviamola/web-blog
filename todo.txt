Todo next:
* add syntax help for markdown/textile in edit page
* an easy way to import posts from real blog locally, so that I can test changes
  in a more meaningful way
* archives.html should use articles_json, instead of us using another memcache data
* better 404 handling (all should redirect to 404.html?${orig_url})
* show articles tagged e.g. with 'fav' as another list on index page if in
  admin mode
* use http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/ for pop-up tags page

Maybe todo someday:
* add per-tag atom feeds (/atom.xml?tag=tag) so that I can e.g. easily add feeds
  for sumatra-only announcements just by tagging announcement posts with unique
  tag
* ability to see previous versions of blog posts
* only load prettify js/css if there's code in the post
* design where clicking on a tag shows overlaid window with articles with this
  tag (to make browsing more efficient)
* somehow integrate my del.icio.us tags into index page
* implement micro-blogging aggregator like http://dotat.at/:/ (automatically sync
  del.icio.us bookmarks every day)
