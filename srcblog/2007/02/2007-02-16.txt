Title: memset() considered harmful

Conclusion: use memzero(addr, size) instead of memset(addr, 0, size) to avoid making frequent memset() mistake of giving parameters in the wrong order.<br /><br />memset() is another example where following established convention leads people to doing the wrong thing. One of the most frequent uses for memset() is to zero-out a piece of memory. The problem with memset() is that it's easy to swap the "value to set" with "count of values to set" parameters. They're both ints, so the compiler won't complain and humans are not that good at remembering things of that nature. Combined with laziness, another human affliction, it leads to many cases where memset() is misused and ends-up being a no-op (because 0, the value, is passed as size, so it ends up doing nothing). I've seen this in my own code, I've seen this in other people's code and you can see for yourself how many people got it wrong with <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=memset%5Cs*%5C%28.%2B%2C%5Cs*0%5Cs*%5C%29&amp;btnG=Search">this query</a>.<br /><br />And a solution is so simple: write a trivial wrapper memzero(void *s, int size). Not only is it a better name but removes possibility of this particular mistake to ever happen again. On Windows you don't even have to write it since it's there as ZeroMemory(). Some unixes have bzero(), but it's an ugly name and I don't think it's widely available so writing memzero() utility function is a good idea anyway.<br /><br />
