Title: wTail release

I've released <a href="/software/wtail/">wTail</a>. wTail does on Windows what tail does on Unix. You can monitor changes to a text file. Ideal for watching log files or Apache error logs during development. Requires  .NET Framework 1.1.

The only interesting thing about the app is how easy it was to write. I don't know .NET very well yet I was able to piece a useful application. It's only about 600 lines of code but can do what it can thanks to all the classes in .NET framework and excellent <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">scintailla editor control</a> (and its <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scide/">.NET wrapper</a>).
