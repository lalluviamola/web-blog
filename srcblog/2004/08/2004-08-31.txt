Title: DocSynch - multi-editor plugin for collaborative text editing

Looks like someone is reading this blog after all. Yesterday I wrote about new collaborative text editor for Windows called <a href="http://me.sphere.pl/">multi-editoro</a> and a reader pointed me to <a href="http://docsynch.sourceforge.net">DocSynch</a>.

DocSynch is an interesting approach to building collaborative editor: it only implements a protocol layer based on IRC and plugs into existing editors. Currently they have a plugin for <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> and are planning additional plugins for Eclipse, vim and Visual Studio. 

Another day, another text editor to check out.
