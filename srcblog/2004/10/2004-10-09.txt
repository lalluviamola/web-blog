Title: Alan Cox on writing better software.

<a href="http://www.pingwales.co.uk/software/cox-on-better-software.html">This presentation</a> by Alan Cox, famous for his work on Linux kernel, is worth propagating so I'm doing my part.

Cox doesn't say anything new. It's a good thing, because usually new ideas turn out to be wildly incorrect. What he does is a very nice summary of known techniques for writing better software i.e. software with less bugs. You'll get the same (and more) by reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/">Code Complete</a> 2nd ed, but it's a nice summary of a particular topic (Code Complete covers much more, is much bigger and therefore more difficult to digest) and it doesn't hurt to read about this stuff one more time.

Videos of this talk are <a href="http://www.itwales.com/998632.htm">also available</a>.
