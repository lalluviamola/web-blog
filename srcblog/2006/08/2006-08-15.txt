Title: Order of #include headers in C/C++

One thing I've learned is that maintaining good #include hierarchy (which is closely related to good design i.e. good partitioning of code into independent modules) requires eternal vigilance. It's easy to slack off and end up with a mess (circular dependencies or files that compile only because some other file happened to have been included somewhere in #include chain).

This mess is not a theoretical problem: it becomes very real when you modify the code and suddenly it doesn't compile because of wrong #include dependencies that are hard to track down and fix.

One big project I've worked on had this problem and a running joke was that every couple of months some developer would get determined to fix it once and for all by cleaning up headers. After all, how hard can it be? Turns out it was very hard and no-one succeeded.

For that reason I cringe every time I see #include  &lt;stdafx.cpp&gt;- it's a free ticket to future dependency hell.

A trick I recently settled upon helps to keep clean #include hierarchy. In the past (for no reason I can remember) I would put #include for system includes (like  or ) first in my *.c files. Those days the first #include in module foo.c is for "foo.h".

Why?

The golden rule for #include files is that if a module bar.c uses foo.c, everything needed to compile foo.c should be defined in foo.h. Chances are that foo.h uses definitions defined in system includes. If all places that #include "foo.h" also include those system includes before foo.h, things will compile just fine but only by accident.

Which is not a problem until you forget to #include those system includes and are faced with weird ("it used to work just fine") compiler errors.

Including it's own #define as the first thing helps to spot those mistakes early.
