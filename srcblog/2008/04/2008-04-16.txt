Title: Software worth buying - SftpDrive and ExpanDrive

<p><a href="http://www.sftpdrive.com/">SftpDrive</a> and <a href="http://www.magnetk.com/expandrive">ExpanDrive</a> is really the same program, except named differently for different OSes. SftpDrive is for Windows and ExpanDrive is for Mac.</p>

<p>It does one thing very well: it allows mounting any ssh accessible directory as a hard-drive/volume so that all programs running on your Mac/PC can access it as if it was a local drive.</p>

<p>One use for that is as a replacement for sftp GUI client.</p>

<p>But what is really great is that it greatly improves interaction with remote servers, be it an Amazon EC2 instance or a co-located server. When I had to edit files on remote Linux servers, I used to ssh and use Emacs for editing. Despite investing many hours in learning Emacs and elisp (to the point that some of the keystrokes are hard-wired in my brain) but I&#8217;m definitely disgruntled Emacs user and in my love-and-hate relation with it I have much more hate than love. Not to mention that for editing C/C++ code nothing comes even close to Source Insight.
Now I can just mount a directory and transparently edit remote files using my favorite, most familiar editor.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple idea but the brilliance of SftpDrive is that it works really, really well and on sufficiently fast connection I can comfortably edit big projects. This might seem like an obvious property of such program but my experience with Samba (either when accessing my NAS over wireless Wi-Fi N network or accessing a filesystem exported from Linux running on Windows under VMWare) shows that this obvious property is lacking and trying to edit large code base in Source Insight on a samba-exported files is an exercise in restrain from chewing your own hand when Source Insight locks up for painful seconds when you&#8217;re in the middle of typing code.</p>

<p>Two thumbs up for SftpDrive/ExpanDrive. If only they also supported mounting S3 as a filesystem.</p>
