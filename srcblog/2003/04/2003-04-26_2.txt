Title: Do you read the old papers?

<b>Do you read the old papers?</b>

Alan Kay's talk at O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference was widely reported.
Here's one of the most complete <a href="http://craphound.com/kayetcon2003">notes from the talk</a>.
Read it, it's good. There's one thing in the talk that got my attention. During 
the talk Kay demonstrated a lot
of cool systems designed more than 30 years ago. His point was that those 
systems were better than what we have today. To quote:

<blockquote><i>
This stuff is better than anything in our handhelds today. We could implement it
from they papers they wrote then, but no one reads the papers that were written
in the 60s.
</i></blockquote>

I think he meant that no one bothers to read those papers i.e. it's our laziness at fault. 
But I found more credible reason: those papers are not easily available. For 
example I tried to find Sutherland's 1963 MIT thesis on his Sketchpad, which 
pioneered interactive graphics. It's not freely available on-line. You can buy a 
PDF version from MIT library for $29 (not $6, like Kay said in the talk). I did 
buy it as an exercise but the price is ridiculously high and it's MIT's failure 
as an educational institution that they greedily squeeze every last cent from 
their copyrights.<p>A quick Google and <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/">CiteSeer</a>
searches for Engelbart papers also turned up nothing.
<p>Even if those papers were freely available there's a problem of selection. 
Thanks to web we have problems with information overload. Too much stuff to 
process. We need to filter and one good strategy of filtering is trusted 
referral i.e. if someone we trust says that a given paper is good, we might read 
it. For example I spent $29 on Sketchpad paper because Kay (whom I trust) 
mentioned it. Ironically it's people like Kay could fix this situation. Why 
don't they put a web page with recommended papers and let the blog word-of-mouth 
do the meme spreading thing? I couldn't do it because no-one cares about 
&quot;Krzysztof Kowalczyk's recommended papers&quot; page but a lot of people would care 
about &quot;Alan Kay's recommended papers&quot;.
<p>BTW: for $50 you can also buy a book
<a href="http://www.siggraph.org/publications/seminal-graphics.shtml">&quot;Seminal 
Graphics&quot;</a> that contains Sketchpad thesis (and other break-through papers).
