Title: Abut Face - second edition

<b>Abut Face - second edition.</b>

I became a fan of Alan Cooper after reading
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672316498/">The Inmates 
Are Running The Asylum</a>. I then read About Face. I was pleasantly surprised 
when I found a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764526413/">new edition 
of About Face</a> while strolling through my local Barnes &amp; Noble. Cooper is 
successful, opinionated and makes sense. If UI design, oops, I mean interaction 
design, is your thing, go and read the book.
