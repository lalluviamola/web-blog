Title: Programmers don't steal enough.

<b>Programmers don't steal enough.</b>

Now that I have your attention: what I really mean is that software designer do 
not take advantage of the Giants as much as they could.<p>It's sad that the act 
of building on the works of others, a necessity for progress, is labeled as 
stealing by those who are blinded by dreams of easy money so much that they fail 
to recognize that everyone, including themselves, is better off in a world where 
we can freely build on ideas of others. Unfortunately those people have enough 
money, bad taste and political savvy to force upon us copyright terms of insane 
lengths and damaging patent policies.
<p>Wise people recognized long ago that we all owe a big debt to those who came 
before us for their ideas and whatever our contribution to the pool of knowledge 
might be, it'll be miniscule compared to collective knowledge gathered so far 
that we were able to build upon.

It's scary to think what will happen if patent system will degenerate to the point when 
it'll allow monopolizing fairly obvious yet crucial ideas. What would happen if 
someone secured a patent for text editing system, making it impossible to create 
a competing text editor. What would happen if someone secured a patent for 
client-server communication making it impossible to create web (or one of 
hundreds useful applications)? Everybody would suffer because the whole computer 
industry would freeze. One lucky soul could charge monopolistic prices for the 
only implementation of text editing idea but it would lack the incentive to 
improve it. Both high-prices and lack of features would lead to meager adoption. 
The vendor might think that he's in heaven but everyone else would be much worse 
off than in an alternative universe where thriving competition drives the prices 
down and quickly improves the software making it useful and affordable for more 
people, indirectly stimulating hardware purchases which in turn stimulates 
creating more kinds of software. Ironically, the vendor would also end up with 
smaller revenues than in the alternative universe because free competition would 
create a market much bigger and one lucky winner that would dominate this market 
would earn profits unheard of in any other kind of enterprise.<p>So let's take 
advantage of the fact that we're not yet in a world like that. Thousand flowers 
can still bloom and your mission is to take existing flowers and make them 
slightly better. Let's rip off each other's ideas, let's build on each other's 
work, let's compete - that's the way to make users happy. I claim that we don't 
do it nearly enough. You would think that because of fierce competition good 
ideas in software would immediately get replicated but my observations rather lead me 
to nod with understanding when I'm reminded of those words:

Below are a few examples of neat software ideas that I've seen in at least once 
and would like everyone else to copy in their products.<p>1. Emacs has a great 
implementation of the &quot;intelligent auto-completion&quot; feature. While it's a 
standard feature in many (although not all) IDEs those days it usually only 
works for a specific kinds of text e.g. it might auto-complete C/Java 
function/method names and parameters and it requires pre-population of the 
auto-completion data. Emacs will build the list of suggestions by parsing the 
current text so it learns from what you've already typed. Works wonders - I 
became depended on this feature a few hours after discovering it. Now every 
editor that doesn't have it is painful to use. Please, o unknown programmer, 
steal this idea.
<p>2. There are 2 popular ways to implement spell-checking:
<ul>
  <li>user has to invoke a menu item, gets a dialog box and is forced to 
  sequentially go through every misspelled word in the document and decide 
  whether it should be replaced, ignored, added to dictionary etc. Gets annoying 
  if you spell-check the same&nbsp; part multiple times and have to ignore the 
  same words over and over again.</li>
  <li>pointing out misspelled words directly on the screen by e.g. putting read 
  squiggly lines underneath and letting user to correct spelling using 
  mouse-activated context-menus</li>
</ul>
<p>The second method has been with us for quite some time and is obviously 
better that the first one yet there are still programs that do it the hard-way 
(e.g. Macromedia Dreamweaver).
<p>3. There are more than 2 ways to implement searching in a text editor. One 
popular way is to have a permanent Find dialog box with a field to enter text 
we're searching for and a button for Find Next. The dialog box will sometimes 
obscure the text we're working on requiring us to move it around. Some pervert 
designers also force us to use mouse in order to switch the search directions 
(i.e. either forward or backward) by making this option a drop-box or a radio 
button. Why this design is still in use while there is a superior solution: 
pop-up the dialog only for entering the text to search, pressing enter dismisses 
the dialog and navigates to first match. We also have key strokes for Find 
Previous and Find Next actions (I like to map them to F3/F4 keys). That way 
there's no need to use the mouse, no need to take your hand away from the 
keyboard - that's important for all the touch-typists out there.
<p>Additionally Emacs has a small improvement of this idiom: it highlights all 
the matches in the currently visible portion of the document.
<p>4. Bookmarks in a text editor are quite useful when writing code. For example 
imagine that you just wrote the .h file with function declarations and you're 
writing the implementation in a corresponding .c file. I usually find myself 
unable to remember the exact details of what is the name of the parameter x or 
what exactly is the name of a function etc. so I have to frequently switch 
back-and-forth between the files to refresh my memory. If that's only two files, 
you can usually get by with other methods (just switching between buffers in 
Emacs or arranging the display to see both files at the same time) but I found 
that if the feature is well implemented then I prefer to use it even in two 
files case and the more places you need to bookmark the more valuable it 
becomes. But here's the tricky part: &quot;well implemented&quot;. It's crucial that 
navigating to bookmarked places is quick. I've seen only one editor that 
implements it well: Source Insight. With a single keystroke (Ctrl-M) you can 
both set a bookmark and navigate to a bookmarked place (don't just believe me, 
download free evaluation version of Source Insight and play with it). Sadly, 
Emacs implements bookmarks poorly - key sequences are too long that managing 
bookmarks is more trouble than it's worth it. So if you implement a text editor, 
here's an idea for you: steal Source Insight's bookmarks management. It's 
excellent.
<p>5. People who use third party file managers (instead of built-in Explorer) 
are usually power users. They might need to drop into command line to do things 
that are not easy to do from GUI like grep through files, launch compilation 
etc. I first saw this feature in Total Commander: there's additional text edit 
field at the bottom of the window. If you type something there and press enter, 
it'll be executed as a command in the directory that is shown in the active 
pane. It's a great feature that saved me a lot of time (as compared to 
explicitly launching cmd window and mindlessly navigating to the directory that 
I already have selected in my file manager). Yet not every file manager has it. 
The result is that I won't be using those file managers: once I've tasted the 
usefulness of it, I refuse to use a tool that doesn't give it to me.</p>
<p>Maybe we should have a collection of such &quot;best design for doing foo&quot; 
somewhere on the web. Then if, for example, someone created a new text editor 
and it lacked some of the useful features or implemented them in a way inferior 
to existing implementation, we could send him a link to this page and say: dude, 
we're not gonna use your software until you implement all those features. 
Please, do implement all the great ideas you have that make your text editor 
better than others, but this is your baseline. Anything worse than that is not 
gonna cut it.
