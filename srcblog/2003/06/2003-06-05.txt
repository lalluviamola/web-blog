Title: Given enough eyeballs make all bugs shallow...

<b>Given enough eyeballs make all bugs shallow...</b> One famous argument made 
  by <a href="http://armedndangerous.blogspot.com/">Eric Raymond</a> in favor 
  of open-source is "<a href="http://www.openresources.com/documents/cathedral-bazaar/node4.html">given 
  enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.</a>&quot; The argument goes like this: 
  in open-source you get the source code to software so people can look at it 
  and discover bugs. This kind of examination isn't possible in closed source 
  development therefore open source is better and leads to software of higher 
  quality.
<p>There's only one problem: <strong>in real world you don't have enough eyeballs</strong>, 
  therefore the argument remains purely theoretical. 
<p>Here's a little story: I found an interesting (judging by screenshots), open-source 
  software meld (which is a GUI for CVS). It only runs under Linux so I fired 
  up my RedHat 8 (a mainstream Linux distribution) and tried to run it. I've downloaded 
  the sources and tried to run it but failed because it depends on pygtk that 
  I didn't have installed. Looking for rpms for obscure packages is usually a 
  waste of time so I just grabbed the latest sources for pygtk, compiled and installed 
  it (at which point I did something that a majority of users isn't capable of 
  (and they shouldn't be)). Then I run meld:
<pre>
[kjk@localhost meld]$ ./meld
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>

<p>Which basically says that there was something wrong with the software. I'm 
  a software developer by profession and I'm capable of fixing the problem, whatever 
  it might be. Segmentation fault is usually caused by trying to access memory 
  you're not allowed to access and, if you have things set up properly, you'll 
  get dumped into a debugger in a place in the program exactly where the problem 
  happened. From that it's usually simple to look up the callstack, see the sequence 
  of calls and figure out why you're playing with invalid pointer. The thing is: 
  I won't bother. This software is not crucial for me, I can live without it. 
  If I had a machine set up for debugging, had everything compiled with debugging 
  symbols and assuming that the debugger would work (which is not given at all, 
  for a long time gdb didn't support threads) it would probably take me a few 
  hours to figure out the problem in the code I see for the first time. But I 
  don't have this so it would take me a few days to get to the point I can start 
  useful debugging. So I give up without thinking.
<p>In real life:
<ul>
  <li>your environment isn't comfortably set up for immediate debugging</li>
  <li>getting started on any software project of decent size has a steep learning 
    curve; in practice this means that no-one will do that just to fix a bug - 
    too much work for too little gain</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no argument that having the source is better than not having it but 
  I argue that, with a few exceptions, it doesn't change the quality of open source 
  software because no-one bothers to look at the source and contribute small fixes. 
  Just look at any open source project that isn't Linux or Apache (those are 2 
  examples of very few exceptions) - they are all desperately (and mostly in vain) 
  looking for contributors.
