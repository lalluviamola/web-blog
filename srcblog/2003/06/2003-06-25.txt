Title: Why consistency is important in software design.

<b>Why consistency is important in software design.</b>

I have a problem: none of the available file managers really meet my needs. 
There's always something that bothers me either because a feature is missing or 
(I think) could work better. That's why I'm constantly looking for something 
better. I've tried many file managers: Salamander, Total Commander,
<a href="http://www.frigate3.com/">Frigate</a> (and a few others that I cannot 
recall so easily). Out of those I tried Frigate is the best but I keep looking 
and that's why recently I tried another one: Directory Opus. I remember 
Directory Opus from my Amiga days: it was THE file manager on that platform, 
packed with features and nice to use. Amiga went down and took the whole market 
for Amiga software with it but it looks like Directory Opus folks averted the 
disaster by porting their software to Windows. This post is about how they lost 
a potential costumer (me) because of lack of consistency with Windows.<p>File 
managers have long history, dating back to DOS days and Norton Commander who 
ruled that market (and was cloned multiple times). On Windows we have two 
general styles of file management:</p>
<ul>
  <li>one that works just like Explorer (built into Windows)</li>
  <li>second that works more or less like Norton Commander</li>
</ul>
<p>By now we all expect some things to work a certain way: F5 is copy, F6 is 
move, F2 is rename, Ins selects a single file, you have two panes, you can 
drag-and-drop files between them using a mouse etc. There's no particular reason 
to use F2 instead of Ctrl-C except that everyone excepts Ctrl-C to mean &quot;Copy 
from a clipboard&quot;.
<p>Every file managers seems to implement the golden standard set by Norton 
Commander. That is: every except Directory Opus. You might think that this is a 
small thing but it's not. I was quickly infuriated by things not working the way 
I was expected them to behave. Among other things:
<ul>
  <li>there's not right-click-drag-and-drop (which usually allows me to choose 
  move/copy/create shortcut when I perform drop)</li>
  <li>F5, F6 (and probably many others) aren't mapped to the same operations as 
  in NC</li>
  <li>Ins doesn't select/deselect a file (in fact, there doesn't seem to be 
  possible to do it not using the mouse which renders keyboard navigation 
  largely useless)</li>
</ul>
<p>Customization is possible so I was able to fix at least some of the keyboard 
mappings but I quickly gave up on Directory Opus even though it seems to be a 
very solid product, has all the basic capabilities and maybe even has features 
not available anywhere else.
<p>The moral of the story: don't be gratuitously different than anyone else. Be 
as consistent with the platform as possible. There are cases where you simply 
find a better way of doing things and that justifies being different, but 
keyboard mappings aren't the place to innovate.
