Title: Software can always be better.

I told you that Frigate is the best file manager I know but it doesn't mean that 
I think that it couldn't be better. 

<p>Recently I wrote about the need for being 
consistent. Ironically, there's another, opposite side to this story: it seems 
that usually people just stick with the tried ideas which makes for suboptimal 
progress in software.</p>

<p>The best place to observe that is in a category with lots 
of competition e.g. file manager, simple text editors or, to use a recent 
example, Wikis or RSS aggregators. It looks like the first entrants create such 
a strong precedent that the followers are usually content with copying them and 
adding just a few, relatively small features. I rarely see a radical 
improvements or a significant number of new features in any given applications.</p>

<p>They slowly grow as a whole because everyone copies other people's features 
(which is good) but when I look at the difference between Frigate and Norton 
Commander I'm really disappointed by the progress in the state-of-the-art of 
file management apps in more than 10 years. </p>

<p>There's probably more than one reason for that:<ul>
  <li>writing software, in general, is hard</li>
  <li>there's probably not much money in the &quot;just another file manager&quot; 
  business (given the insane competition from free stuff (including Explorer 
  built into Windows) and other file managers) so it's probably fairly easy to 
  whip up something that is comparable to existing stuff but much harder to 
  justify investing into making it much better</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll make a claim that part of the problem is software designer's mental 
block caused by existing implementations that are good enough. The solution to 
that problem? A conscious effort on finding and implementing new, useful 
features. (Here I have to note that Apple, with their iApps, is doing a good job 
by significantly improving upon tired (you would think) concepts like music 
player or chat.)</p>
<p>Here are my ideas for a few features that I haven't seen in existing file 
managers.</p>
<p>Build a database of files. It's not, by any means, a novel idea but I haven't 
seen anyone doing it. The reason is that it makes it possible to improve some 
features. For example, finding files by name on a hard-drive is still painfully 
slow because scanning the file system of a large hard-drive is slow. If we had 
names and other vital properties indexed in a database it would be very fast 
(probably even possible to provide interactive performance). The same holds for 
calculating the size of a directory: it's slow if you re-scan all files in a 
directory with lots of files. If we had this data pre-calculated, there's no 
reason to have it always displayed. Of course, there are problems with this 
approach: you have re-scan the hard-drive periodically and you cannot guarantee 
being always in perfect sync with the hard-drive but those disadvantages are 
minor compared to what they enable.</p>
<p>Virtual folders. In a way virtual folders are already in: most file managers 
enable you too treat a zip file as a directory but I want more. Once we have 
file names, their sizes and other important meta-data in a database, why 
shouldn't I be able to create virtual folder that shows the files matching an 
arbitrary SQL query. That's ultimate flexibility. How would it be useful? For 
example I frequently view PDF files, create text files or Excel spreadsheets, 
view Word files, PowerPoint files etc. The files are never in the same directory 
so when I want to switch from within Adobe Acrobat Reader between a currently 
viewed PDF files in my d:downloads directory 
to a PDF file in &quot;My Documents&quot; directory I have some folder navigation to do. 
Annoying if you do it often. Applications usually try to make my life easier by 
providing a list of a few recently used documents but those are 
application-specific fixes and I usually find myself accessing more documents 
than the length of this list. If I had my imaginary friend I could create a 
virtual folder with 10 (or 20 or whatever is the appropriate limit for me) 
recently accessed Excel spreadsheets or Word documents or PDF documents. Or I 
could have one folder for all those types of documents. Or I could have a folder 
with manually maintained list of files that I access most frequently (program 
could even help me choose which files are those by watching which files I access 
most frequently). Or I could have a virtual folder than only shows jpeg files 
from all my hard-drives. I could view the files in this folder in a traditional, 
hierarchical view or as a flat list. I could also sort them as in a regular 
folder i.e. by name or data. Or I could search for files matching given name but 
only restricted to the folder with jpeg files. And it all would be fast. Think 
how easy would it be to browse through my collection of digital photos, how easy 
would it be to find recently taken pictures.
<p>Integrated ssh/sftp. It's the Internet era, god damn it. I've seen ftp 
integration but not ssh/sftp (there's <a href="http://winscp.vse.cz/eng/">WinSCP</a>, 
which is mostly about ssh but it's a lousy file manager - I want first-class 
file manager with first-class support for ssh).
<p>Break out with 2-pane tradition. Here I'm not convinced that it's even a good 
idea but it's certainly something that could be tried. Why do we usually have 2+ 
panes: because that's makes it easy to move files between directories (we see 
both the files we selected in the source directory and the destination 
directory). Explorer has only one pane and you can copy files by selecting them 
in source directory, doing Ctrl-C, navigating to destination directory and doing 
Ctrl-V. Possible but inferior to the 2-pane way because we might loose track of 
what is it that we're copying and it's not possible to select files from 
multiple directories at once. Can we improve upon that? Imagine that we only 
have one pane but it gets split vertically when you select files. The bottom 
shows currently selected files (you unselect files by removing them from that 
bottom view). This allows us to select files from multiple directories at once, 
we always know what files are selected and to copy/move files to a different 
directory we just navigate there and press F5/F6. We could improve upon that by 
adding tabs so we can easily navigate between frequently accessed folders (the 
bottom view with selected files wouldn't change).
