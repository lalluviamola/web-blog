Title: Wozniak's speech.

<B>Wozniak's speech.</B> The ability to watch <A href="http://wean1.ulib.org/cgi-bin/metawin-lectures.pl?target=Lectures/Distinguished%20Lectures/2002">this wonderful Wozniak's speech</A> many days after it has been given in a place I've never seen represents the best of Internet: shift the time, shrink the space, provide more equal access to interesting information. &#013;&#010;<P/>Another observation is that <A href="http://www.woz.org/">Wozniak</A>'s story (who co-founded Apple with Jobs) confirms my theory about success: all you need to achieve success is a lot of hard work. This talk is a very compressed story of Wozniak's technical progress, from 5th grade till the creating Apple and more. And his story is so refreshing given the the recent realization (as a result of dot-com bomb) that being driven by greed and get-rich-fast schemes isn't a viable long-term strategy. Wozniak was a brilliant, hard-working engineer. And he would remain so even if he didn't make a killing on Apple. Brilliance is not enough to make a difference, he was lucky but luck is always a tip of the iceberg. The foundation on which the success rests is hard work.
