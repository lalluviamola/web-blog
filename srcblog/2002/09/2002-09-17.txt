Title: You'll have a job.

<B>You'll have a job.</B> This <A href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&amp;ixPost=15621&amp;ixReplies=8">excellent post</A> presents 12 reasons why a good programmer should not worry about employment. It comes from the "I couldn't say it better myself" department. I remember discussion with other programmers where they claimed that because VB and other such tools make programming easier, there will be less work and less demand for programmers. <A href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;q=%22to+which+I+say%22">To which I say</A>: bull. Those tools make <I>some</I> programming easier but at the same time a lot of programming becomes harder (because our software gets bigger), there are tons of new software that begs to be written and every year we tend to come up with a new, uncharted territory waiting to be filled with new software (web servers anyone?, IM systems, weblog software, native XML databases, web search engines - the list goes on and on). There'll be plenty of work for good people.
