Title: High Tech start up.

<b>High Tech start up</b>.
I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/068487170X">High Tech start up</a> because I've mistaken it for a different book on the subject of start ups I've wanted to buy because of good reviews on Amazon.com. The subtitle of this book is "the complete handbook for creating successful new high tech companies". Completness is a weakness of this book. Author wanted to cover all the steps of creating a new company, from getting the idea, drafting a business plan, getting VC funding to doing an IPO. He did cover all of those topics but the result is just a boring lundry list of things to think about. It won't hurt to read it but in real life nothing will be like what's described in the book.
