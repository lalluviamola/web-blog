Title: Laws of marketing #5 (focus)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a 
word in the prospect's mind". Owning in this context means that if 
people hear or see this word they usually connect it with a company 
that "owns" this word. IBM owns "computer". FedEx owns "overnight". 
You can't take somebody else's word.
<P><I>My comment: I 
can't help but to think that this book has overly simplified 
thinking. Being simple is good but not when the reality is more 
complex. First this law seems to be derived from mega-corporation. 
The problem is that there aren't that many companies that are big 
enough to own a word in people's consciousness. Therefore the advice 
is only possibly relevant to a few people who design marketing 
campaigns for those behemots but useless for all small business. 
There aren't even enough words to own to satisfy 10% of business in 
US. </I></P>
