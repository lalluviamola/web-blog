Title: A fine interview with Marcelo...

<A href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-943064.html">A fine interview</A> with Marcelo, Linux 2.4 kernel maintainer. He says many wise things. One thing ringed less true than others, though: &#013;&#010;<BLOCKQUOTE><I>We need to get ordinary people used to using Linux. It isn't that it's so hard to use, it's just different.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>Too bad it isn&#146;t true. Linux is hard to use not only because it&#146;s different but because, well, it is difficult. I keep seeing the command line attitude (&#147;<EM>using command line isn&#146;t that hard&#148;</EM> or <EM>&#147;all you need to do is ./configure &amp; make &amp; make install, what&#146;s so hard about that?&#148;</EM>). That&#146;s so out of touch with reality that reading Cooper&#146;s <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316498/">&#148;Inmates are running the asylum&#148;</A> should be a required reading for people who hold such beliefs. I&#146;m not trying to bash Marcelo here, he&#146;s an extremely able person, but, as Cooper points out, able people are easy to dismiss the difficulties that less able people may have. This tendency is natural but can be fought with enough introspection. And it should be fought because if people want bigger adoption of Linux they have to understand why Linux isn&#146;t being adopted and one of the reasons is that it&#146;s hard to use. Thinking otherwise is just self-denial and an obvious consequence is that if you don&#146;t think something is a problem, you will never fix the problem.
