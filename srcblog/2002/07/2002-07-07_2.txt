Title: Laws of marketing #7 (ladder)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: marketing strategy depends on your position in the 
market. If you're No. 2 you use different strategy than 
when you're No. 1 or 3. 

<p>Avis was No. 2 in car rental and 
when they advertised as "finest in rent-a-cars" they had 
losses because their marketing wasn't credible (you can't 
be "finest" being No. 2). </p>

<p>They had profit when they 
switched to "Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why go 
with us? We try harder".</p>

<p>Then they had another disastrous campaign 
when they started claiming "Avis is going to be No. 1".</p>

<p><i>My comment: I agree with 
the premise (kind of marketing depends on your position 
in the market). However the book says very little about 
what kind of strategy one should use in a given position 
(except for a few examples). Additionally their examples 
feel like they oversimplify complex reality. Even 
assuming that the data about e.g. Avis is fully correct 
(i.e. that there is strong correlation between Avis 
profits and the kind of marketing campaign) I find it 
hardly unlikely that there's a causality relationship. I 
don't think that good or bad marketing champaign can make or break a 
company. I can see how this point of view can be 
attractive for marketing people but I would think that 
success depends on more factors. Marketing might be an 
important factor but certainly not a dominant one.</i></p>
