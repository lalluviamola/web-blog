Title: Laws of marketing #4 (perception)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: marketing is not about products (their features or 
quality) but about perceptions (how people perceive products). 
Reality doesn't exists, what we call "reality" is just a perception 
of reality that we create in our minds. Honda is a leading Japanese 
car manufacturer in US but only third in Japan (after Toyota and 
Nissan). If the quality of the car was the most important thing it 
should have the same position in all markets. In Japan, however, 
people perceive Honda as a manufacturer of motorcycles. 

<P>Therefore what's important is that marketing should be focused on 
changing the perception.<P>

<I>My comment: I have mixed 
feelings about this law. I fully accept the premise (that perceptions 
is our reality). However our perception is mostly grounded in 
objective reality. After all if it's raining not many people will 
maintain the perception that it's wonderfully sunny day. Therefore 
one way of changing the perception is to change the reality (e.g. 
improve the quality of your cars). Maybe having the desired reality 
is not enough to achieve desired perception but it's hard to argue 
that you can create any perception you want regardless of reality. If 
your car breaks down every 10 miles no amount of marketing will 
convince people that it has high quality.</I></P>
