Title: Laws of marketing #10 (division)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: over time a category will divide and become two or 
more categories. E.g. computers started as a single category but 
broke up into mainframes, workstations, personal computers, laptops 
etc. Cars started as a single category but divided into luxury cars, 
sport cars, RVs, minivans etc. Companies often don't understand that 
and instead think that categories are combining, believe in synergy. 
Leader can maintain dominance by addressing emerging categories with 
new brand names instead of using brand name successful in one 
category in a new category. E.g. when Honda wanted to go up-market it 
created a new brand, Acura.
