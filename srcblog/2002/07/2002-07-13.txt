Title: Laws of marketing #16 (singularity)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: in each situation, only one move will produce substantial results. 
People tend to think that success is the result of a lot of small efforts well 
executed, that working harder is a way to success. In marketing the only thing that 
works is a single, bold stroke.
