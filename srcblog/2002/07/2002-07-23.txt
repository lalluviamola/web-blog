Title: Open Source is Philanthropy

<BLOCKQUOTE><A href="http://cubicmetercrystal.com/log/log-0004.html#16-april-2002">
coder blog</A>: Business is business, and business loves proprietary
patented technology with its pseudo monopolies used to leverage 
revenue and increase value. These kind of leverage points used to 
drive income are noticeably missing in the open source model. 
Instead, businesses focusing on open source tend to use the services 
model for revenue. It makes a lot of business sense to use open 
source software in your business, but it doesn't make much sense to 
produce open source software in your business.</BLOCKQUOTE>

I meant to write about impossibility of making money 
<STRONG>writing</STRONG> open source but this guy was there first.
