Title: Laws of marketing #1 (leadership)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0887306667">The
book</a> says: being first in the market is better than having a 
better product than a competition. Examples: we all remember who 
first flew over Atlantic or who was the first man on the moon but 
almost no-one knows who was the second. Heineken was the first 
imported beer in USA and still is No. 1 imported beer. Same for 
Miller Lite, first domestic light beer. Being first doesn't matter if 
the idea/product is not good.

<I>My comments:</I>
<I>I think it's better to say that being first gives one extremely 
big advantage over competition but doesn't guarantee the success. 
It's rather obvious that it doesn't matter that you're first to 
market if no-one needs your product or if your product is very bad. 
There are many examples from computer industry that disapprove this 
rule (i.e. first spreadsheet isn't the dominant spreadsheet, first 
word processor isn't the dominant word processor) so there are (many) 
cases showing that n-th product can overtake early leaders. But it's 
very hard and usually requires the leader to make huge mistakes.
